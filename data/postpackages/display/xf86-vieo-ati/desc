The xf86-video-ati (radeon) driver:

    Works with Radeon chipsets up to HD 6xxx and 7xxxM (latest Northern Islands chipsets).
        Radeons up to the X1xxx series are fully supported, stable, and full 2D and 3D acceleration are 
provided.
        Radeons from HD 2xxx to HD 6xxx have full 2D acceleration and functional 3D acceleration, but are not 
supported by all the features that the proprietary driver provides (for example, powersaving is still in a 
testing phase). 
    Supports DRI1, RandR 1.2/1.3, EXA acceleration and kernel mode-setting/DRI2 (with the latest Linux kernel, 
libdrm and Mesa versions). 

Generally, xf86-video-ati should be your first choice, no matter which ATI card you own. In case you need to 
use a driver for newer ATI cards, you should prefer the proprietary catalyst driver.
